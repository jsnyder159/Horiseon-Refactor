Code refactor request hw1
https://jsnyder159.github.io/Horiseon-Refactor/#search-engine-optimization

Requested by Horiseon to update HTML elements to accessibility standards to optimize site for search engines by updating HTML to semantic structure with logical structure, independent of styling and position. Make sure that when viewing icons and images that accessible alt attributes were present. Making sure heading attributes fell into sequential order and the title was concise and descriptive.

Steps taken:

-All links for search in header were fixed and will move you to proper location on the page. Search engine optimization was missing "id" attribute.

-Added color key to top of CSS for quick reference and ease for future modifications.

-CSS selectors and properties were consolidated. Three groups for the same function were made into one.

-CSS was organized so that a given element is with other functions for that element.

-CSS comments added to CSS and HTML . CSS areas are broken by /* ----------- (element) ----------*/. Elements inside of the larger label are commented on above function.

-HTML was updated removing div's and replacing them with proper standard element labels. div for navigation lines was renamed to nav, changed labeling in "Links in Header to body locations" in CSS from div to nav to continue functionality.

-All images and icons were given alt attributes with meaningful identifications.

-Website looks like requested mock up and is functional.

-Updated title from "website" to "Horiseon maximizing your business's online pressence."
